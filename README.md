Hi! I'm Prokop Hanzl. I'm a linguistics &Â phonetics student in Prague, Czech Republic. You can find out more at https://dustah.com.

### What I'm Working On
I'm currently developing a German to Swiss German dictionary based on a language corpus. Not only does Swiss German have many varieties spoken in different parts of the country, but very few of those have a widely accepted orthography. My dictionary will, therefore, provide the user with different acceptable spellings and their relative counts (with the option to sort by canton).
